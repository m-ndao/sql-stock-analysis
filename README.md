# üìà SQL-Based Stock Market Analysis (2010‚Äì2022)

## üîç Overview  
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to extract, analyze, and summarize key financial indicators from large-scale stock market data. Using a CRSP dataset of eight companies from 2010 to 2022, I explored trends in market capitalization, returns, and exchange/industry classification using structured queries and data modeling techniques.

## üìÅ Dataset Details

- **Source**: [CRSP ‚Äì Center for Research in Security Prices](https://www.crsp.org/)
- **Companies**:  
  - WSFS Financial Corp  
  - SVB Financial Group  
  - Texas Instruments Inc.  
  - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.  
  - Mattel Inc.  
  - GAP Inc.  
  - Intel Corp  
  - Rio Tinto Plc
- **Time Frame**: Monthly data from January 2010 to December 2022  
- **Variables**:
  - `PERMNO`: Unique stock identifier
  - `COMNAM`: Company name
  - `EXCHCD`: Exchange code (e.g., NASDAQ = 3)
  - `TICKER`: Stock ticker
  - `NAICS`: Industry classification (2-digit)
  - `PRC`: Last trading price (USD)
  - `VOL`: Volume of shares traded
  - `RET`: Monthly return
  - `SHROUT`: Shares outstanding
  - `MCAP`: Market Capitalization = PRC √ó SHROUT

## üß† Entity-Relationship (ER) Model

The ER diagram below illustrates how stock, company, and industry entities are structured:

## üìä Market Capitalization Statistics

SQL query used:
```sql
SELECT PERMNO, MAX(MCAP) 'Max', MIN(MCAP) 'Min', ROUND(AVG(MCAP), 2) 'Mean'
FROM assignment2223.a1crspm
GROUP BY PERMNO;
```

### ‚û§ Visualization of Results:

## üßæ Industry & Exchange-Based Filtering (Compound SQL Query)

SQL `UNION` query:
```sql
SELECT PERMNO, COMNAM, EXCHCD, TICKER, NAICS 
FROM assignment2223.a1crspf WHERE EXCHCD = 3
UNION 
SELECT PERMNO, COMNAM, EXCHCD, TICKER, NAICS
FROM assignment2223.a1crspf WHERE NAICS = 52
ORDER BY PERMNO;
```

---

## üìâ View: Monthly Returns Under 3%

SQL `VIEW` created:
```sql
CREATE VIEW assignment2223.Returns AS
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(date, '%M %Y') AS Date, PERMNO, PERMCO, PRC, VOL, ROUND(RET, 4) AS RET, SHROUT, MCAP
FROM assignment2223.a1crspm
WHERE RET < 0.03;
```

### ‚û§ Sample Output:

## üí¨ Discussion: Is SQL Essential for Financial Analysts?

- SQL is foundational for **querying**, **filtering**, and **aggregating** large financial datasets.
- Its limitations include advanced statistical modeling (e.g., ARIMA, regression, machine learning).
- Integration with tools like **SparkSQL**, **Python (pandas, statsmodels)**, and **Power BI/Tableau** can fill in gaps.
